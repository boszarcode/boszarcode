Hello, I am Boszarcode and I am currently interested in web development as computer science in general.
I started my journey in computer science during 2020 after many years of not doing any computer related activities.

I have a degree in Electronic Music but my main passion has now switched to Computer Science.

I am currently following a course to learn HTML & CSS and will continue after this course to Javascript. 
I would also like to learn Python more extensively as I started a course for it but never finished.
As well as doing front-end development I would also like to learn back-end development to accompany my website building.

In the future I would like to become a full-stack developer and do this as my main career as I currently work in production at a medical device company.
